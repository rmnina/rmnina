## Hi there 👋

🔭 I'm a **42-school student** and I've been coding since May 2023.

🌱 I’m currently perfecting my learning of the **C language** and I'll soon be diving into **C++**.

🚀 I'm a science enjoyer, and would love to **build spaceships** or work in **astrophysics**.

⭐ Please feel free to navigate through my projects. Many more are to come !
